# CHIP-8

A CHIP-8 and S-CHIP emulator written in C. The core has no I/O and is freestanding (doesn't depend on libc).

**Supported platforms**: "modern" CHIP-8, CHIP-48, S-CHIP 1.0 and S-CHIP 1.1.

## Compilation and usage

To compile the SDL implementation, make sure that SDL2 is installed, and then run `make`.

You can launch the program with the following command:

```
./chip8 <scale-factor> <emulator-frequency> <ROM>
```

For instance:

```
./chip8 10 840 ./ROMs/games/ALIEN
```

Common emulator frequencies: `540`, `840` and `1200` (for S-CHIP games)

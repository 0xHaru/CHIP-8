TIMING

I wanted to decouple the frequency of the delay and sound timer (constant
at 60Hz) from the emulator frequency (variable and adjustable by the player).

I experimented with two different approaches:

1. The game loop delay is variable and depends on the emulator frequency*
   selected by the user. Each emulation cycle handles exactly one instruction.
   The timers are decreased every n-th game loop iteration,
   where n = EMU_FREQ / 60.

   For example, if EMU_FREQ = 540 the delay and sound timer are decreased
   every 9th cycle (540 / 60 = 9).

2. The game loop delay is constant at 16.666ms to achieve a framerate
   of 60fps. In this approach, each emulation cycle deals with a variable
   number of instructions. For instance, if EMU_FREQ = 540 each emulation
   cycle handles 9 instructions.

* Emulator frequency = Number of instructions executed each second

Which one is the better approach?
=================================

In my opinion the second approach is better.

The major downside of the first approach is that it calls a sleep-like function
for a very short of time after each instruction (if IPS=540 the sleep delay
would be around 1.85ms). From my understanding, this type of function doesn't
offer this kind of precision.

So I decided to decouple the frequency of the delay and sound timer (constant
at 60Hz) from the emulator frequency (variable and adjustable by the player)
using the second approach.

The game loop delay is constant at 16.666ms (to achieve a framerate of 60fps),
while the number of instructions executed each emulation cycle is variable.

This allows the timers to be decremented after every emulation cycle at a
constant rate of 60 Hz.

Further considerations
======================

1. Although not all instructions take the same amount of time to be executed,
   even the slowest one requires a negligible amount of time. Meaning that we
   can behave as if they all took the same amount of time.

2. What if the interpreter executes N instructions per cycle and more than
   one of them is a DRW?

   Only the last one will actually be rendered, the previous ones
   will never be displayed!

   This isn't a problem, it's not necessary to render all the DRWs.

   "There's literally no reason to try and push all screen updates to the
   screen as they come. Some games will want to try and do a ton of draws
   at once before a new frame comes across. You'll see that in more modern
   games since you're going to be emulating S-CHIP as well. Some of them will
   require upwards of 400 IPF to run normally (or even more than 2000), so you
   don't want to care about pushing all screen updates sequentially at each
   new frame going to the screen."

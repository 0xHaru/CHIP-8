QUIRKS

CHIP-8 and S-CHIP emulators developed many quirks (ambiguous instructions)
over the years. My emulator will support the following quirks.

SHIFT quirk
===========

Description: On most systems the shift opcodes take Vy as input and stores
             the shifted version of Vy into Vx. The interpreters for the HP48
             took Vx as both the input and the output, introducing the SHIFT quirk.

IfTrue:  Opcodes 8xy6 and 8xyE take Vx as both input and output
IfFalse: Opcodes 8xy6 and 8xyE take Vy as input and Vx as output

JUMP quirk
==========

Description: The jump to <address> + V0 opcode was wrongly implemented on all the HP48
             interpreters as jump to <address> + Vx, introducing the jump quirk.

IfTrue:  Opcode Bxkk jumps to address xkk + Vx
IfFalse: Opcode Bnnn jumps to address nnn + V0

LOAD/STORE quirk 1: increment I register by X
=============================================

Description: On most systems storing and retrieving data between registers
             and memory increments the I register with x + 1 (the number of
             registers read or written). So for each register read or written,
             the index register would be incremented. The CHIP-48 interpreter
             for the HP48 would only increment the I register by x, introducing
             the first LOAD/STORE quirk.

IfTrue:  Fx55 and FX65 increment the I register with x
IfFalse: Fx55 and FX65 increment the I register with x + 1

LOAD/STORE quirk 2: leave I register unchanged
==============================================

Description: On most systems storing and retrieving data between registers
             and memory increments the I register relative to the number
             of registers read or written. The SUPER-CHIP 1.1 interpreter for
             the HP48 however did not increment the I register at all,
             introducing the second LOAD/STORE quirk.

IfTrue:  Fx55 and Fx65 leave the I register unchanged
IfFalse: Fx55 and Fx65 increment the I register
